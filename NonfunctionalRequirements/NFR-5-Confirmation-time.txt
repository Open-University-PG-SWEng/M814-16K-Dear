REQ-ID: NFR-5
Description: The product shall provide a confirmation of booking in a short period of time to the user.  
Type: 12 - Performance Requirements
Rationale: To reduce the time it takes for the overall booking.
Fit Criterion: The product shall provide a confirmation of booking in less than 5 seconds in 97% of bookings.
Originator: Daniel Steimetz
[JacekSKutyla] I would consider adding some safety margins to the fit criterion, for instance: The confirmation should take no longer than 3 seconds in 95% of payments. (I made a similar comment to NFR-2)
[D Steimetz] I agree with you JacekSKutyla on the safety margins.
[Adam Boothroyd] This fit criterion seems quite strict. Given that it is not essential for confirmations to be sent instantly, would it not be better to extend the time to circa 10 seconds to make this criterion more easily achievable?
[JacekSKutyla] Adam's comment seems to me very reasonable. There may be a temptation to lower the level of the performance requirement, unless, we add some empirical data. So imagine, that Daniel also provided us with an additional bit of information in the rationale or in references to his requirement: "Sales department's analysis shown that if the booking confirmation takes more than 3 seconds, over 75% of customers drops the operation". Obviously, I took the numbers out of the blue but I just wanted to show how "solid numbers" may clarify the situation.
[D Steimetz] I do not fully agree with the comments of Adam Boothroyd and JacekSKutyla. One argument I agree with is that we could increase slightly the time from 3 s to 5 s, but not more. The usersâ€™ satisfaction of WIMS will decrease if waiting and response times increase.
