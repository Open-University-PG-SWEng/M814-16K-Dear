Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
[JacekSKutyla] I would consider adding some safety margins to the fit criterion, for instance: The discount calculation should take no longer than 0.002 seconds in 95% of payments.
[Tony Lin] I agree with Jacek. 95% is a generous estimate of those users with connectivity issues etc.
[D Steimetz] I know it sounds very strict but you should add a unit to the decimal '0.02", your fit criterion would be more precise. Otherwise it could be 0.02 minutes etc.
[Igoris K] Perhaps it would make sense to specify time in milliseconds. 0.002 seconds would then be 2ms and 0.02 seconds would be 20ms.
