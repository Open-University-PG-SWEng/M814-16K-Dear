REQ-ID: NFR-7
Description: A user should be able to quickly locate a copy of a specified past report
Type: 11 - Usability
Rationale: In order to analyse financial performance, the user needs to be able to quickly find specific past reports. If this is difficult, the user will get frustrated and this feature won’t get used
Fit Criterion: In at least 85% of instances, a user should be able to locate a specified report within 15 seconds. This time does not include retrieval of the report, which is covered by performance requirements.

REQ-ID: NFR-7
Description: A user should be able to quickly locate a copy of a specified
past report
Type: 11 - Usability 
Rationale: In order to compare performance, the user needs to be able to
access previous reports. If this is difficult, the user will get frustrated and
this feature won’t get used
Fit Criterion: In at least 85% of instances, a user should be able to locate a
specified report within 25 seconds.

Comment [Geoffrey Hayward] It is unclear if the fit criterion relates to a type 12a ‘speed and latency’ or type 11a ‘ease of use’. As you have specified type 11, I would suggest changing ‘… able to locate a specified report …’ to ‘… able to specify a search criterion for locating a report …’.
[Ryan Schranz] I agree with Geoffrey Hayward in regards to the breakdown of the criterion, I would also look at reducing the amount of time it takes to find a given report. 25 seconds seems like a long time for both speed and ease of use.
