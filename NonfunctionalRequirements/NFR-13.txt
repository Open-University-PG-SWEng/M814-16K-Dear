Comments: [Adam Boothroyd] You could have a clearer definition for your fit criterion. Add the version of the program as well.
[Daniel McAssey] I feel this NFR's fit criterion is too subjective, it should properly describe it should be shown in a table row/column/cell layout, a developer may have never used Excel 2017 or have access to it.
