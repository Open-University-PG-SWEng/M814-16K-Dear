[Ryan Schranz] The criterion seems appropriate to the speed of the request, though it might be worth adding something about the accuracy of the request as we need to check for the availability?
[JacekSKutyla] Although I would advocate for 'accuracy' criterion suggested by Ryan, I am not sure how it would apply to this requirement. I mean, a workshop or a class is available or not. Unless we are allowing for over-booking (similarly to airlines), then we could provide a fir criterion similar this one: 'and in 95% the class or workshop in question if not overbooked'.
[Sam Bates] I think your first criterion is fine, but it's dangeroud to try and specify a fit criterion for 100% of cases, which you do by specifying the time taken for the remaining 5% of cases. There, unfortunately, will always be one weird outlier which cannot easily be avoided. I think you're better off not trying to cover all cases and just fit for 95% instead.
[Robert Bashford] I also think the first criterion is fine the accuracy is surely part of the linked functional requirement. If the system returns an already booked class then this a defect linked to the functional requirement.
